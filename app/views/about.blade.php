	<p>Welcome. This is (a first draft of) Metal Ratings & Recommendations.
	The goal of this site is to empower metalheads to discover more metal.</p>

	<p>If you're a metalhead, you probably already know about The Encyclopedia Metallum*, the go-to resource for this sort of thing. They have been gathering and archiving information about metal bands for over ten years. What we would like to do is analyze the relationships between their user data, band data and album data  (adding to the previous analysitical contributions from Empath**).</p>

	<p>We will not be taking any new factual data about bands, artists, or releases, but rather analyzing the hell out of the data that EM generates, and letting users rate and track their preferences for bands, forming a tastes' profile that we can then base recommendations off by running all this data through an algorithm, Netflix-style.</p>

	<p>Ideally this site will help you discover that masterpiece NWOBHM album from the 80s which has been languishing in obscurity but is exactly up your alley.</p>

	<ul>

		<li>**<a href="http://www.furia.com/em/" target="_blank">Empath</a> <a href="http://www.furia.com/page.cgi?type=misc">(with intro here)</a></li>
	</ul>

	<p>(If you are not from DWA-15 but are in fact Hellblazer or Glenn McDonald or anyone else who just wandered in, please note that this is still very much a rough draft, laying down the skeleton (no fancy taste-profile algorithm or data visualizations yet) and will only be live in this manifestation for a few days.)</p>
